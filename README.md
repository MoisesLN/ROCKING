# ROCKING
2D Roguelike game based on the myth of Sisyphus.

##  1. Game mechanics
The game will work in a level-based story mode system. More on the story later!

### 1.1 Colors
- An element of the same color will have no colisions (e.g. A player, when blue, can walk through a blue wall).
- The player is able to change colors using the voice commands or using the keybinds.
- Buttons can be pressed by an element of different color (a box or even the player).
- Boxes are used to reach certain high ground or press buttons.
- Paintbrush: A tool to add another level of complexity to the levels! It can be used by the player to change certain element's colors.

### 1.2 Levels
- Originally thought to have about 20 levels.
- 5 levels of introduction to the basic mechanics.
- 10 (or 15) medium levels, developing the colors to make more creative levels.
- 5 hard levels, special levels making the player really have to think to get through them.

## 2. Story  
**IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON'T READ THIS PART!!!**  
The story of the game will be based on a rich company that's experimenting on people... **RubiGenicBioworks** (or **RGB**!).  
The experiment is called **"Interactive Color Response and Engagement System"** (or **ICRES**), and the protagonist is a subject of it.  
The company injects the ICRES liquid onto the subjects, and they gain the ability to change colors!  
Then, each subject is taken to a variety of "tests" (levels).  
The player will be received by a bot called **V2**, and it will guide the player through the lab!  

Throughout the game, the player will have some choices, and V2 will alert them if the player decides to do actions against the company.  
When the protagonist reaches level 15, they will be given a choice: keep going with V2's instructions, or go against V2 and face a harder challenge.  

**Going with V2:**  
The player will complete the tests and then be met by a tragic end:  
The company will kill them in the final test!  
It was never their plan for someone to complete their challenge, and they surely don't want someone with these powers to walk out this easily.  

**Going against the company:**  
The player enters a prohibited area and meets **V1**, the older version of the "guide bot" that actually tried helping the subjects escape from the company and got taken down for it.  
This path leads to harder challenges and, in the end, a boss fight against **V2**.
